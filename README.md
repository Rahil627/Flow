# Flow (IN DEVELOP :/)
Fatally Lazy On Wednesday - SDL2 based C++ game engine working in 3d space but rendering in fake "isometric" 2d graphics.

No compiling needed. Just include it in your project. Recompile script is for automated compiling main file (testing purpose) and it uses MSYS from MinGW. You need only flow directory from src.

Someday I'll finish this project. Someday...
