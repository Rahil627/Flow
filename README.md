# Flow (IN DEVELOP :/)
Fatally Lazy On Wednesday - SDL2 based C++ game engine working in 3d space but rendering in fake "isometric" 2d graphics. Engine is standalone header file (.hpp) for C++.

I compile it using Wrapper CPP (https://github.com/jegor377/Wrapper-CPP) so if you want to compile the library by yourself then clone the repository and compile it. I created it to be simple to compile but if you find an issue or something then in issues in Wrapper CPP repository. I'll try to fix it.

No compiling needed. Just include src/flow.hpp in your project. Recompile script is for automated compiling main file (testing purpose) and it uses MSYS from MinGW. You need only flow.hpp from src.

Someday I'll finish this project. Someday...
